# Shedule app
One of the most useful on this app is a shedule app. This app allows to create a tasks and manage the progress of their implementation. Besides it allow to attach a peoples to this task. For example if we have a task and we need to attach a executor responsible for this task we can do this. Also we can add people to list and choose someone to add him to task. But if task does not imply a person we can awoid this point. It is possible to mark which tasks have been completed. You can also delete tasks if they are not relevant. To delete or modify a task, you need to swipe the cell to the right.
